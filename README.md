## How this works?
This fetches all your mails from a particular newsletter(probably an email) and stores them as text file.


## Why this?
Well, I am an avid reader of my favourite newsletters and I would not like to miss any of my newsletters that brings in interesting contents adding a little joy in this prosaic life. It helps me sort and allows me to read in my domain of interest. 

## How to Run?
- Put your <b>email</b>, <b>password</b> and the <b>mail of your daily newsletter subscription</b> in the space provided in the python script.
- If everything works fine, you should see the body of your mails coming in as text files in your current directory.
- Else, make sure
  - You have turned on access to less secure apps in your google account.(https://support.google.com/accounts/answer/6010255)
  - To enable IMAP in the settings section of your gmail account.

### TODO
- Output to some fancy pdf files(for better readability)
- Extract images and add text hyperlinks rather than whole links in the file
