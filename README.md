# Gmail Newsletter Parser

## How this works?
This fetches all your mails from a particular newsletter(probably an email) and stores them as text file.

## Why this?
Well, I am an avid reader of my favourite newsletters and I would not like to miss any of my newsletters that brings in interesting contents adding a little joy in this prosaic life. It helps me sort and allows me to read in my domain of interest.
